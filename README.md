# hello-world
Just following the "hello world" tradition...

A little about me:
Today is 7/2/18 and I graduated about 2 weeks ago from UC Santa Cruz with my M.S. - Applied Economics and Finance.
I am looking for work in data analysis or finance and reminding myself everyday that my time spent in school was not all for nought.
I made this GitHub because my friends say its great platform for personal work and projects, so here I am.
At some point in the future, I want to open a BMW specialist shop and a Vietnamese pho restaurant.
